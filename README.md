=====================

Online version of some great work done by Quinn Johnson in python.

Installation:
Make sure you have virtualenv installed, then run these commands:
```bash
virtualenv venv
venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to host a production version, you'll also have to configure mod\_wsgi for apache and set up a virtual host. Contact me if you'd like more details on how to do that.
